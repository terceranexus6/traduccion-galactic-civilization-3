  <StringTable>
    <Label>ThuliumMoonEvent_Dec</Label>
    <String>Long ago, the Precursors captured a small Thulium node and placed it in orbit of this world. We will be able to use this ready source of Thulium to strengthen the hit points of ships made from our shipyard.
Our scientists would also like to study it to see what else we can learn. Technology that can be used to create an artificial moon is not something to be squandered.</String>

    <String>The Precursors who lived on this world before us left behind a completely functional Space Elevator. This will greatly increase our ability to put manufactured goods into space and will prove very useful to our shipyard.
Unfortunately, the public sector and several other groups are putting a great deal of pressure on us. They hope to use the elevator to faciliate their own projects.</String>
