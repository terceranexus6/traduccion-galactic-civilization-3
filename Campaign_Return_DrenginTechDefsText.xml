    <String>Whips don't make slavelings more creative which is problematic, because we have a lot of whips. It turns out that death threats work good though.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginSlavePits_Dec</Label>
    <String>Both our manufacturing and research facilities have been going through slavelings at an alarming rate. They require us to build slave pits to make more slavelings for shoveling into the fires of progress.</String>

    <String>Slave Mills</String>

    <String>The only thing better than cheap slaves are really cheap slaves.</String>
  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginSlaveMills_Dec</Label>
    <String>The nice thing about pits are that they're miserable and decrepit. But they're very space inefficient. By making slave mills we can make more slavelings than ever. We'll just have to make sure the mills are still really miserable and decrepit.</String>
  </StringTable>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginArtificialSlaves_Dec</Label>
    <String>Artificial slavelings take most of the fun out of manufacturing - they just don't beg for their lives and freedom as much. But boy can we sure churn them out in a hurry.</String>

    <String>Some of our slavelings, with gentle encouragement, can be made into excellent researchers. We theorize they will become smarter still with harsh whipping.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginResearchOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>It turns out that when we pack our researchers' kennels closer together, they're better able to share ideas.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginResearchOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>By making our least effective research slavelings into test subjects, we encourage better research and also save an awful lot of money on test subjects.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginResearchExtraction_Dec</Label>
    <String>Some of our research slavelings have been holding out on us! They save their smartest thoughts for plans of escape and eating! So we have found a way to just suck the ideas from their brains. Sometimes they even survive the experience.</String>
  </StringTable>

    <String>Boosts the intelligence of slaves.</String>
  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginIntelligenceAmplification_Dec</Label>
    <String>Applying powerful electrical currents to a slaveling's head was at first just a fun hobby. But by doing it in a very specific way, it can apparently make our slavelings far more intelligent. It still thankfully causes a great deal of pain.</String>
  </StringTable>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginDeeperKnowledge_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our wisest and weakest slavelings predict that we will be able to research even faster if we torture them less. This is a dangerous idea which we will pursue very carefully.</String>

    <String>Our untortured research slavelings have made remarkable progress unlocking the mysteries of the universe. Were we wrong to torture them for so long?</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginBeyondMortality_Dec</Label>
    <String>We were wrong to stop torturing the slavelings! We tried torturing them even harder and look what they came up with! Ascension will allow us new dimensions to spread misery!</String>

    <String>Letting the slaves talk is dangerous but necessary.</String>
  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginResearchCoordination_Dec</Label>
    <String>We don't like when slavelings talk to each other. This is the cause of much whipping. But for the research slaves, sometimes they research better when they talk. This is problematic, but we will let more talking happen for now.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginNeroLinking_Dec</Label>
    <String>By linking slaveling's brains together in a virtual research matrix, they can research even better. We have to create new virtual whips, but that is its own type of fun.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginPlanetarySpecialization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>By shouting at the soil and threatening it with beatings and harsh fertilizers, we can improve plant crop production. Plant crops are horrible tasting, but they keep the slavelings alive at least.</String>

    <String>By installing structures across the landscape that display motivational messages in towering pillars of fire, we can motivate our slavelings to work harder. And certainly hotter.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginXenoAgriculturalAdaptation_Dec</Label>
    <String>Unfortunately, slavelings can't just eat other slavelings - the math just doesn't work. Also, slave meat is too valuable to waste. We need other meat crops to round out our diet, and making the meat crops grow on garbage alien worlds has been tough.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginAgriculturalOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our meat crops are picky eaters, and don't like eating alien plants. But there are so many alien plants! So we started forcing the meat crops to eat them.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Return_DrenginAgriculturalOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Meat crops like lots of space to roam around and eat plant crops. But space is expensive. So we put the meat crops in cages and give them a larger cage where they can take turns roaming.</String>
