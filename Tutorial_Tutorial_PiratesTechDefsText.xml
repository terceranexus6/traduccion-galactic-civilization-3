    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesEngineeringTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>For generations, we've looked up at the stars and wondered, "What if?" Well buckle up, because "if" has happened. By bending space around our ships they're able to use conventional propulsion within a pocket of normal space, while accelerating at vastly greater speeds in reality. The stars have gotten closer.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesInterstellarTravel_Dec</Label>
    <String>Even at the incredible speeds we can travel at now, if we want to journey anywhere beyond the closest stars, we'll need to make significant improvements to our navigational and life support systems. More refined Hyperdrives wouldn't hurt either.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesInterstellarSpecialization1_Dec</Label>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesInterstellarSpecialization2_Dec</Label>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesIonDriveTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>By using magnetic fields to capture ions from the interstellar medium during Hyperdrive flight, we can funnel this additional mass into the exhaust of our conventional fusion engines, increasing the overall speed and efficiency of the propulsion system. We call these Ion Drives, and they make us go faster, basically.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesIonOptimization1_Dec</Label>
    <String>The ion capture technology of our Ion Drives requires a fiendish amount of tuning, which our ship's engineers are only just learning to automate. Once this work is done, we should see slightly higher speeds across our fleet.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesIonOptimization3_Dec</Label>
    <String>Every year our Hyperdrives get more efficient and smaller. Less room for the engines means more room for everything else, benefiting every type of ship we could conceive of.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesWarpFieldTheory_Dec</Label>
    <String>Our researchers are now able to "stack" up the space-bending fields of our Hyperdrives, magnifying the acceleration effect. They call these stacked fields "Warp Fields" and are able to use them to create vastly more powerful engines.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesWarpFieldFocus1_Dec</Label>
    <String>By tuning the arrangement of stacked hyperfields in a variety of dimensions, we've found some surprisingly cheap ways to improve the speed of our Warp Drives.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesWarpFieldFocus3_Dec</Label>
    <String>With a bit of experience working with the effects of stacked hyperfields, we've determined that we were stacking them inefficiently. Smaller field generators can achieve the same effects as their fatter predecessors.</String>

    <String>Allows the construction of Exotic Hyperdrives.</String>
  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesHyperwarpWaves_Dec</Label>
    <String>A hyperwarp wave creates a cascading series of warp fields at a distance in front of the vessel, allowing the warp drive to effectively compress already compressed space. That glosses over a number of complicated mathematical issues which had to be sorted out to make it work, but our researchers now believe we can begin developing even faster drives.</String>

  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesStellarFoldingTech_Dec</Label>
    <String>Stellar folding is the ultimate extension of hyperfield technology, bending space on a scale never seen before, with hyperfields approaching the diameter of a star. Our ships are now the fastest in the galaxy, and perhaps the fastest the galaxy has ever seen.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesGravityFieldManipulation_Dec</Label>
    <String>It took many decades of effort before our physicists were finally able to find the graviton. It turned out to be inside us the whole time. Inside of everything the whole time, to be technical. Anyways, having harnessed its power, we can now generate large artificial gravity fields, which should greatly increase the maneuverability and tactical options of our ships in combat.</String>

  </StringTable>
 
  <StringTable>
    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesHyperfieldDisruption_Dec</Label>
    <String>By analyzing the interference effects of multiple hyperwave fields from different ships traveling in close proximity, and combining that with our ability to generate hyperfield effects at ever increasing ranges, we can now limit the speed of enemy ships within the range of a properly equipped starbase.</String>

    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesSubspaceSensors_Dec</Label>
    <String>Subspace is our term for the 12-dimension region of space which lies at right angles to and a little bit behind our universe. It's that place which is just permanently in the corner of your eye, and it took some very smart people a very long time to figure out a way to look at it. The upshot of all this is that it enables us to peer over much longer distances than ever before.</String>

    <String>When a ragtag group of science-accountants teamed up with the goal of identifying cost savings in our most advanced sensor systems, few believed they had a chance.

    <String>A careful analysis of the latest generation of sensor systems has revealed that several of their components don't technically have to exist in this universe. By shifting their workload into another plane, we can reduce the amount of mass we have to lug around in ours.</String>

    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesLifeSupport_Dec</Label>
    <String>It seems surprising that the factor limiting the travel range for most ships is its life support system, but there you have it. For anything less than a colony ship, keeping the occupants alive is now a bigger challenge than keeping the engines fueled.</String>

    <Label>Tutorial_PiratesLifeSupportOptimization2_Dec</Label>
    <String>Reducing the cost of building life support systems is one of those necessary things we have to do that we don't want to advertise too much. It's hard enough finding naval recruits as it is.</String>

    <String>Our growing familiarity with various force field technologies has enabled us to replace our primitive mechanical life support systems with more elegant field based processors.

    <String>It turns out that by aerating the nutrient sludge we provide our crews it takes up significantly more volume in their stomachs, making them feel full with less food. There are some associated problems with, uh, gas, but we're coming up with special filters to address that.</String>
