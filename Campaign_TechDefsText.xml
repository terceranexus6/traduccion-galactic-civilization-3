    <String>Tasked with improving the survivability of our naval officers in combat situations, our engineer's first solution: "Don't enter combat situations," was less than helpful.

    <String>Coordinating the activities and direction of an entire galaxy-wide civilization is tremendously difficult. There's just so many damned people.
